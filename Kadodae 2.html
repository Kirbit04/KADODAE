				<big style="text-align:justify"><u style="color:1178de"><b>Kadodae creation</b></u> was business started during the corona period.<br>
				 Melody was only in <u style="color:1178de"><b>form 2</b></u> when she starte this business due to her past childhood love for creating beaded accessories.
				Currently she is studying Architecture in Kenyatta University. The business is currently on its third year of existence.
				The business has been in patnership with <u style="color:1178de"><b>Tenani Lipgloss</b></u> and has made a great debut in the market. Many appreciate its uniqueness.
				When she started this business, she was at her lowest point, coming up with this business was an escape, which ended up being successfull.
				Not only did it provide a good getaway, it also earned her income, patnerships and enablelled her to heal. It also made her appreciate her nation and culture.
				Which she ensured to share with those around through her creations.Her creations symbolises her love and appreciation for her culture,
				which also can be a getaway from problems instead of depending on any form of harmful ways of escaping reality like most teenagers
				of our generation do. She also ensures that art is seen as a form of expression.</big><br>
